## Description

- This is an application that allows users to create accounts for different sites. The User creates a username and password for various accounts. The application gives you the option of generating passwords for you for various accounts. One also has the option of creating his/her own password. The generated password is made of varying characters and is strong enough that it can't be easily hacked.
